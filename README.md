# NVue

An experimental view rendering engine for ASP.NET Core that's based on the Vue.js [template syntax](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html). It is an alternative to the [Razor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor?view=aspnetcore-2.2) view engine.

To be clear, there is no JavaScript involved. Only the HTML-based declarative syntax of Vue.js is used with C# expressions.
